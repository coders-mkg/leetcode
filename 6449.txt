//https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-349/problems/collecting-chocolates/



You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size n representing the cost of collecting different chocolates. Each chocolate is of a different type, and originally, the chocolate at ith index is of ith type.

In one operation, you can do the following with an incurred cost of x:

Simultaneously change the chocolate of ith type to (i + 1)th type for all indexes i where 0 <= i < n - 1. When i == n - 1, that chocolate will be changed to type of the chocolate at index 0.
Return the minimum cost to collect chocolates of all types, given that you can perform as many operations as you would like.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [20,1,15], x = 5
Output: 13
Explanation: Initially, the chocolate types are [0,1,2]. We will buy the 1st type of chocolate at a cost of 1.
Now, we will perform the operation at a cost of 5, and the types of chocolates will become [2,0,1]. We will buy the 0th type of chocolate at a cost of 1.
Now, we will again perform the operation at a cost of 5, and the chocolate types will become [1,2,0]. We will buy the 2nd type of chocolate at a cost of 1. 
Thus, the total cost will become (1 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 1) = 13. We can prove that this is optimal.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], x = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: We will collect all three types of chocolates at their own price without performing any operations. Therefore, the total cost is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
1 <= x <= 109
